    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Everyone experiences moments in their life where they need or want professional help.
      Professional help can range from learning a hobby to repairing a car. Although there are more
      ways to connect with a professional than ever before, sometimes the professional help that is
      given isn't helpful or sufficient. As part of my time at Careerfoundry, I took on the challenge of
      creating the app Expert to address this problem.</p>

    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Users need a way to communicate with experts at a given time in a productive manner because
they lack important problem solving information only experts can provide.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>Create an app which will allow users to communicate with experts at a given time and be
satisfied with their time and money spent.</p>
<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ol><li>Users might need to contact experts at a time that doesn't coincide with the time of the
    experts.</li>
    <li>Experts might insufficiently answer user questions, thus wasting the time and money of
      the user.</li>
      <li>In certain circumstances there might be a conflict between demand and supply. Perhaps
        the demand for an expert in one area might be too niche for example.</li>
        <li>The qualifications for an expert might be too subjective in certain areas such as a video
          game fighter professional.</li>
          <li>Maybe an expert or user might share confidential information with a 3rd party</li>
            </ol>
    <h4>Goals</h4>
<ol><li>Create an app that provides a satisfactory experience to both users and experts.</li>
        <li>Create a filter system that will provide users more options to search for experts of any
            topic.</li>
          <li>Be a trustworthy company that is known for ethics and high standard of quality.</li>
            <li>Be accessible to both users and experts. Make the experience affordable for users and
                profitable for experts.</li></ol>
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <p>To help Expert stand out, I started competitive analysis in which I focused on two freelancer
      companies known as Fiverr and Freelancer. Since my project focuses on connecting users to
      experts for help, I thought that focusing on other apps that focus on connecting between users
      and professional freelancers would allow me to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
      Analyzing and identifying these companies' weaknesses and strengths would be crucial for
      Expert to breakout into the market.</p>

<h4>Personas</h4>
<p>To better understand the user who Expert would be serving, I met with several volunteers and
asked questions regarding their thoughts on experts. After compiling all of the notes I had taken
through the interview, I created personas to give a face to whom Expert would serve. I created
the following personas below.</p>

<h3>User Mental Models and Journeys</h3>
<p>After finishing creating my personas, I created a mental model of how they might feel with one
of the frustrations they might be struggling with and how they might feel while using the Expert
app to remedy their frustration. Below is an example of Jun's mental model and journey.</p>

</picture></div>
<h3>Sitemap</h3>
<p>Once I finished completing my personas mental models and journeys, I moved onto foundational design starting with a sitemap. The sitemap is used to give a visual idea of a
branch of features and to act as a predecessor to low type fidelity wireframes.</p>

      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/SitemapImage.png" alt="Sitemap">
</picture></div>
<h3>Low-Fidelity</h3>
<p>After finishing my sitemap, I moved onto creating wireframes. Before I created a low-fidelity wireframe, I created scenarios which users would perform a task. In the example, below the
task would be using the filter system to find an expert. This task using low-fidelity wireframes would conceptualize how a user would perform a task.</p>

      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/Low-fidelityImage2.png" alt="Low-Fidelity2">
</picture></div>
<p>In the example above, the user taps the filer icon in the search bar and is able to pull up a box what allows various options on how to filter out an expert</p>
<h3>Mid-fidelity Prototype</h3>
<p>My High-Fidelity Prototype improved upon the foundations built by the Low and Mid-Fidelity Prototypes which were created earlier. The High-Fidelity Prototype continued to remain in grey
scale and would add UI elements such as color and a set typography later on. It was important for me to make certain that this High-Fidelity Prototype would be straight forward for test
participants to be able to accomplish any task that would be presented before them.</p>
