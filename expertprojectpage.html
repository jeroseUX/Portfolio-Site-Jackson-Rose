    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Everyone experiences moments in their life where they need or want professional help.
      Professional help can range from learning a hobby to repairing a car. Although there are more
      ways to connect with a professional than ever before, sometimes the professional help that is
      given isn't helpful or sufficient. As part of my time at Careerfoundry, I took on the challenge of
      creating the app Expert to address this problem.</p>
      <p>Timeline: September 2021 - April 2022</p>
      <p>Role: UX Researcher and UX Designer</p>

    <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<p>Users need a way to communicate with experts at a given time in a productive manner because
they lack important problem solving information only experts can provide.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>Create an app which will allow users to communicate with experts at a given time and be
satisfied with their time and money spent.</p>
<h4>Challenges</h4>

<ol><li>Users might need to contact experts at a time that doesn't coincide with the time of the
    experts.</li>
    <li>Experts might insufficiently answer user questions, thus wasting the time and money of
      the user.</li>
      <li>In certain circumstances there might be a conflict between demand and supply. Perhaps
        the demand for an expert in one area might be too niche for example.</li>
        <li>The qualifications for an expert might be too subjective in certain areas such as a video
          game fighter professional.</li>
          <li>Maybe an expert or user might share confidential information with a 3rd party</li>
            </ol>
    <h4>Goals</h4>
<ol><li>Create an app that provides a satisfactory experience to both users and experts.</li>
        <li>Create a filter system that will provide users more options to search for experts of any
            topic.</li>
          <li>Be a trustworthy company that is known for ethics and high standard of quality.</li>
            <li>Be accessible to both users and experts. Make the experience affordable for users and
                profitable for experts.</li></ol>
    <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
    <p>To help Expert stand out, I started competitive analysis in which I focused on two freelancer
      companies known as Fiverr and Freelancer. Since my project focuses on connecting users to
      experts for help, I thought that focusing on other apps that focus on connecting between users
      and professional freelancers would allow me to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
      Analyzing and identifying these companies' weaknesses and strengths would be crucial for
      Expert to breakout into the market.</p>

<h4>Personas</h4>
<p>To better understand the user who Expert would be serving, I met with several volunteers and
asked questions regarding their thoughts on experts. After compiling all of the notes I had taken
through the interview, I created personas to give a face to whom Expert would serve. I created
the following personas below.</p>
<!--Jun info-->

</div>
<h3>User Mental Models and Journeys</h3>
<p>After finishing creating my personas, I created a mental model of how they might feel with one
of the frustrations they might be struggling with and how they might feel while using the Expert
app to remedy their frustration. Below is an example of Jun's mental model and journey.</p>
<div><picture>
      <source srcset="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/UserMentalModelJourney.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/UserMentalModelJourney.png" alt="UserMentalModelJourney1">
</picture></div>
<h3>Sitemap</h3>
<p>Once I finished completing my personas mental models and journeys, I moved onto foundational design starting with a sitemap. The sitemap is used to give a visual idea of a
branch of features and to act as a predecessor to low type fidelity wireframes.</p>
<div><picture>
      <source srcset="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/SitemapImage.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/SitemapImage.png" alt="Sitemap">
</picture></div>
<h3>Low-Fidelity</h3>
<p>After finishing my sitemap, I moved onto creating wireframes. Before I created a low-fidelity wireframe, I created scenarios which users would perform a task. In the example, below the
task would be using the filter system to find an expert. This task using low-fidelity wireframes would conceptualize how a user would perform a task.</p>
<div><picture>
      <source srcset="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/Low-fidelityImage1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/Low-fidelityImage2.png" alt="Low-Fidelity2">
</picture></div>
<p>In the example above, the user taps the filer icon in the search bar and is able to pull up a box what allows various options on how to filter out an expert</p>
<h3>Mid-fidelity Prototype</h3>
<p>My High-Fidelity Prototype improved upon the foundations built by the Low and Mid-Fidelity Prototypes which were created earlier. The High-Fidelity Prototype continued to remain in grey
scale and would add UI elements such as color and a set typography later on. It was important for me to make certain that this High-Fidelity Prototype would be straight forward for test
participants to be able to accomplish any task that would be presented before them.</p>
<div><picture>
      <source srcset="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/High-fidImage.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/High-fidImage.png" alt="High Fidelity Image">
</picture></div>
<p>The photo above contains all of the pages that were used to make my High-Fidelity Prototype.
Stock photos are placed to replace the placeholder images that were present in my Mid-Fidelity
Prototype. In addition, the High-Fidelity Prototype is interactable and can be used for usability
testing purposes.</p>
<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
<p>After I finished my high-fidelity prototype, I scouted for six participants to participate in a test
analysis using a test script I created. After I recruited my test participants, I moderated the test
through Zoom and recorded our testing session with their consent. After I finished the testing
session, I reviewed the footage and took notes. I then organized my notes into an affinity map
to clearly organize my thoughts.</p>
<div><picture>

      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/AffinityMapImage.png" alt="Affinity Image">
</picture></div>
<h3>Usability Testing Results</h3>
<p>After creating my affinity map, I created a rainbow spreadsheet to further organize my notes
and I used the Jakob's rating scale to evaluate their experience based off of the affinity map
results. Based on where their experience landed on Jakob's rating scale, I decided what need to
be changed before creating the final mockup.</p>

      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/RainbowSpreadsheetImage.png" alt="Jakob Image">
</picture></div>
<h3>Usablity Test Report</h3>
<p>Usability testing reports show the thought process of the participants who test out the
prototype and the missteps of the app. In this case, the usability testing reports were separated
into 3 different categories: issues, suggested changes, and evidence. The example below is one
of the usability test reports that was shown.</p>
<div><picture>
      <source srcset="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/TestReportImage1.png" media="(max-width:767px)">

      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/testReportImage2.png" alt="Test Report 2 Image">
</picture></div>
<p>Issue: Participants didn't understand the message box icon (low)</p>
<p>Suggested change: Change the message box icon and replace it with a more recognizable message box icon.</p>
<p>Evidence: Some of the participants were initially confused from the message box icon. They were quick to
  recognize that the icon was meant to represent the messages, but they were confused why I chose that icon to do so.</p>
<h3>Preference Testing</h3>
<p>Usability testing reports show the thought process of the participants who test out the
prototype and the missteps of the app. In this case, the usability testing reports were separated
into 3 different categories: issues, suggested changes, and evidence. The example below is one
of the usability test reports that was shown.</p>
<div><picture>
      <source srcset="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/PreferenceImageA.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/PreferenceImageA.png" alt="PreferenceImageA">

<div><picture>
      <source srcset="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/PreferenceImageB.png" media="(max-width:767px)">
      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/PreferenceImageB.png" alt="PreferenceImageB">
</picture></div>
<p>Image A was preferred by 77% of participants. Some of the reasons being that image A felt
cleaner and was not as busy. In total, participants who chose image A had little to no critiques
regarding the Sign In screen. However, participants did criticize the box shapes and centering. in
The end I addressed their concerns and added a sign-up button and forgotten password link.</p>

      <img src="img/ExpertStudyCaseImage/RevisedImageA.png" alt="RevisedImageA">
</picture></div>
<h3>Visual Design Principles</h3>
<p>In order to make Expert visually pleasing, I made certain to apply visual design principles so that
users would have an easy time navigating through the app. I used Gestalt Psychology and
principles of design such as emphasis, similarity, hierarchy, and more in my prototype to help
refine the design.</p>
<p>Emphasis-highlighitng one section over</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>The Expert logo is enlarged to catch the user's attention that they are entering the Expert login
screen.</p>
<p>The Expert logo is enlarged to catch the user's attention that they are entering the Expert login
screen.</p>
<p>The "OR" is enlarged so that users can also know that they can sign in using one of their social
media accounts.</p>
<p>Balance - distributing the visual weight of objects on screen to ensure that on one side feels too
heavy.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Symmetry is used to make certain that none of the icons, button, and box are spaced out irregularly.</p>
<p>Similarity - grouping visually similar elements to achieve a similar goal.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>The "Sign In" button has the same font, round corners, and a blue background to matches the
username and password to help the user to know that they are related with signing in.</p>

<h3>Style Guide and Pattern Library</h3>
<p>Upon finishing design principles, I started working on HTML to have a better understanding of
the transition from a prototype to the front end of a program. HTML made realize how critical
and time consuming coding would be for the overall product.</p>

<h3>Grid Layout</h3>
<p>After finishing my style guide and pattern library, I looked over the mobile and desktop versions
of Expert and used a grid system to space everything accordingly. Using the grid system created
a greater sense of unity among the elements that were located on the screen.</p>

</picture></div>
<h3>Feedback and Revisions</h3>
<p>After I completed the grids for the app, I decided to collaborate with fellow UX designers and
have them critique my prototype. I looked over their feedback and I revised my app
accordingly. Below is one of the many revisions I made with the prototype based on their
feedback.</p>

</picture></div>
<h3>Designing for Accessibility</h3>
<p>After completing all of the main functions of the Expert app, it was time for me to add the final
touches. One of the most important parts was to design for accessibility. One of the issues that
I noticed was that the messages page had an issue conveying to the user whether or not the
expert was online as well as which messages the user had read or not. To remedy this situation
I added the words "Active Now" below the icon to indicate whether or not an expert was
online. In addition, I only used colors to tell whether a message had been read or not. I made
certain to add the words read and unread with bold white text to draw the users attention to
whether the most recent message had been read.</p>

<h2>Project Take Aways and Prototype Link</h2>
<h3> Focusing on the User</h3>
<p>As a UX designer, I am passionate about all of my design choices. I ensure that all of my design choices are based on some principle of design. Despite how confident and how proud I am of my design choices, there will always be times when further improvement or changes are required of my designs. When a difference of opinion occurs with the user or client, I make certain to explain my design choices while being ready to make any necessary changes even though it may be difficult. I take the feedback and criticisms and use them as an opportunity to improve upon my future design choices.</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p> At times I take for granted is a product's accessibility. Some people are born with certain disabilities such as being color-blind which can cause a major accessibility issues in a product. For example, if an app relies solely on color to signal to users, then a color-blind person will suffer while using said app. Realizing this made me realize how important it is for products to be as accessible to everyone as possible. Even language plays a role in whether a product will be accessible for someone.</p>
<h3>UX Design is based on a story</h3>
<p>Anytime a product is created, there is a story behind it with a problem being the starting point.
The nail was created since someone at some point in human history needed to bind material
together. Ships were created so that humans could travel bodies of water to improve trade or
search for new lands of travel. Every product that I work on is based on a problem and it is my
job as a UX Designer to show the story of how this product came to be based on UX Design
principles.</p>
