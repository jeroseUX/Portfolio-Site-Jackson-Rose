    <p>Overview</p>
    <p>Everyone experiences moments in their life where they need or want professional help.
      Professional help can range from learning a hobby to repairing a car. Although there are more
      ways to connect with a professional than ever before, sometimes the professional help that is
      given isn't helpful or sufficient. As part of my time at Careerfoundry, I took on the challenge of
      creating the app Expert to address this problem.</p>
      <p>Timeline: September 2021 - April 2022</p>

    <p>Problem Statement</p>
<p>Users need a way to communicate with experts at a given time in a productive manner because
they lack important problem solving information only experts can provide.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>Create an app which will allow users to communicate with experts at a given time and be
satisfied with their time and money spent.</p>
<p>Challenges</p>

<ol><li>Users might need to contact experts at a time that doesn't coincide with the time of the
    experts.</li>
    <li>Experts might insufficiently answer user questions, thus wasting the time and money of
      the user.</li>
      <li>In certain circumstances there might be a conflict between demand and supply. Perhaps
        the demand for an expert in one area might be too niche for example.</li>
        <li>The qualifications for an expert might be too subjective in certain areas such as a video
          game fighter professional.</li>
          <li>Maybe an expert or user might share confidential information with a 3rd party</li>
            </ol>
    <p>Goals</p>
<ol><li>Create an app that provides a satisfactory experience to both users and experts.</li>
        <li>Create a filter system that will provide users more options to search for experts of any
            topic.</li>
          <li>Be a trustworthy company that is known for ethics and high standard of quality.</li>
            <li>Be accessible to both users and experts. Make the experience affordable for users and
                profitable for experts.</li></ol>
    <p>Competitive Analysis</p>
    <p>To help Expert stand out, I started competitive analysis in which I focused on two freelancer
      companies known as Fiverr and Freelancer. Since my project focuses on connecting users to
      experts for help, I thought that focusing on other apps that focus on connecting between users
      and professional freelancers would allow me to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
      Analyzing and identifying these companies' weaknesses and strengths would be crucial for
      Expert to breakout into the market. </p>
